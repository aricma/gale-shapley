# gale-shapley
This project is a coding exercise. I use it to learn new languages and to keep track of the languages I learned.

The [gale-shapley algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeâ€“Shapley_algorithm) is an interesting solution to a match making problem. 
Given you have two groups with opionions about the other group. How do you match each item from the first group to an item of the other group and respect each items whiches(ranking of items of the other group) in the process.
